# Rock_paper_scissor

This is a simple Python program that allows two players to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against each other. 
The program prompts one player to make a selection (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and generates a random choice for the second player. 
It then determines the winner based on the game rules and displays the result.
