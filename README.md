# Rock Paper Scissor

This is a simple Python program that allows two players to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against each other. 
The program prompts one player to make a selection (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and generates a random choice for the second player. 
It then determines the winner based on the game rules and displays the result.

##How to Play
Run the Python script using a compatible Python interpreter (e.g., Python 3.x).
Player 1 will be prompted to input their choice by typing "rock," "paper," or "scissors" (case-insensitive).
The program will randomly select a choice for Player 2.
The result of the game will be displayed on the console.
